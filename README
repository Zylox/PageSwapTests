Zachary Higginbotham project 2

Whenever there was a page fault, but room was available in the table, i set the pageReplaced to 65535
as a sentinel value.

Currenlty, at the time of writing this, the LRU algorithm does not work because somehow my list
ends up with a circular node. I have no idea how this is happening but...it is. Probably a stupid mistake
beyond measure. All others seem to work, although we were given no confirmation cases.
